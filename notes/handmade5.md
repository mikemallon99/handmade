Review of windows graphics
- when using the stack, compiler can assume a lot of stuff that will allow it to speed things up
- inlining
    - short code, just insert it right into the function rather than make new function call
- aliasing
    - 2 pointers that go to the same memory
- compiler, optimizer
    - totally change your code to where its not recognizeable
- assertions
    - errors that dont manifest themselves often
    - errorrs that are hard to find
    - errors that manifest themselves quickly and obviously
- take things that are globals, wrap them up into a structure
    - good to do after figuring out what you need with globals
- lots of conceptual cleanup stuff with no payoff
    - all of your cleanup should have some kind of payoff
- bad to pass bundle structs as function header
    - forces people to call function using the struct even if they have width and height separate
    - cant arbitrarily comibne offscreen buffer stuff, so that stays in function header
- stack growing downwards
    - stack suggests its 2mb
    - recursive function could definitiely overflow the stack
- hinstance is the process handle
    - processes have their own memory space, need to know where to point to memory from within that processes memory space
