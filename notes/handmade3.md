episode 3 - allocating a backbuffer
- you used to just have to provide the gpu with a buffer to display
- oop ppl like to make sure they have symmetrical allocation and deletion of objects
    - RAII
    - almost always better that things are acquired & released in aggregate
    - think about things as part of a group
    - my guess for why you would do this is that by doing things in waves theres less opportunities for mistakes
- global variable dogma
    - not needed, but theres reasons why dogmas come about
    - more you can make code clear about what it can/cant access, the better
    - its okay in win32 platform layer cause theres not much crossover code here
- static always initializes to 0
- display device context vs memory device context
    - rasterizing to a display vs a buffer
- you can use task manager to see if you have memory leaks
