fixed / floating point arithmetic
- fixed is to have part of the int be a regular int, part be a fraction
- floating point is the same thing, but the dividing line can vary depending on the number
all the horse power in most CPUs lives in floating point arithmetic
- not a good idea to do fixed point anymore

cross platform stuff:
- bad if the control flow is the same on every platform
- we should allow each platform to have its own control flow
