episode 4:
- there were reasons that we dont need a DC that I dont totally understand
- padding is good so theres no unaligned penalties
    - 32 bit boundaries
- a lot of the OS stuff is very fast paced lol
- you can make sure nobody has a stale pointer to an object by using VirtualProtect
    - tracks use after free bug
- declare things as global when youre figuring out how it should work, then take them off global once its working
- pointer math
    - pitch: add to row[0] value to get to next row
    - stride: add to cur idx value to get to next column in the row
- nvim: nice to have workflow where you can go through compile errors and instantly jump to a line
- C silently multiplies subtraction by size of a unit of a thing? with a pointer
- we turned computer with big operating system to 1980s computer that we can play with
    - bitmap that we can draw to
- GetMessageA is blocking
    - when theres no messages, it will shut down
    - we need to not wait for windows for our game
- Used to actually need to define types
- calling malloc
    - calls a bunch of c runtime code and then eventually runs VirtualAlloc
    - malloc/new are c runtime library ways of running VirtualAlloc
